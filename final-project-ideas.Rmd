## Gov50-Data Final Project Ideas

The goal of my final project is to help people start new profitable ventures by creating an informative data visualization. Depending on the availability of datasets, I plan to focus on one of the following questions.

1) User needs. What products or services do people actually need and will pay for? What problems have many customers expressed online? How are people and organizations spending money? 

2) Startup success. What type of startups have historically been most successful? What are untapped and high-potential startup ideas, products, or industries that don't require much capital resources? Is the risk and pain of startup life worth it compared to other stable jobs?
